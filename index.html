   <p>n 1860, the Indigo revolt spread throughout the Bengal province. Shalghar Madhua in Kushtia district was one of the forerunners in this movement.[4] It inspired all indigo farmers in Kushtia to refrain from paying government taxes.[4] Subsequently, with the publication of the Indigo Commission Report, an act was passed prohibiting coercion of cultivators for indigo cultivation and the measure led to the end of the movement.[9]
